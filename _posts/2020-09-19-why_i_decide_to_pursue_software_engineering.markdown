I took a personality test several years ago and found Software Engineering is a recommended career and I’ve since wanted to pursue it for many reasons. Software Engineering allows the possibility of working remotely, being more financially stable then I’ve ever known, and would satisfy my desire to use my mind more than my body for work. Living in a ski resort community I was aware that anything could happen. If I were to get sick or hurt while participating in the extreme sports I enjoy I wouldn’t have to worry about my job being at stake. I knew I would have to join a bootcamp to gain the skills quickly but wasn't sure when the stars would align to allow me to do this. In December I was in a bad ski accident that has left me bound to a wheelchair. I am blessed to be receiving so much support from my family that is allowing me to make this dream of being a Software Engineer a reality.
